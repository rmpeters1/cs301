CS321_Project_Paint_GUI

Paint Gui:

    The goal of the project was to build an imitation mspaint or macpaint.
    A lot of the focus would need to be on aesthetics because the tools 
    themselves seemed like they would take quite a bit of work and time to build.
    The main issue was that I have not worked on a javascript+html+css based program on my
    own before and a lot of time actually went into positioning things on the page.
    
    Basic paint program with minimum functionality, on a HTML5 canvas. 
    The existing menus are the paint tools, color picker, and main canvas to draw on.
    The size of each brush can be changed via a slider.
    There are reset and save buttons, reset will clear the canvas and save is still in progress.
